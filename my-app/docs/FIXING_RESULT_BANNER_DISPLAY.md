# Fixing Result Banner Display Issue

## Problem
The result banner in DiceAnimation was not displaying correctly. It was checking for `result.won` but the actual property name from GameInterface is `result.isWinner`.

## Root Cause

### GameInterface sets the result with:
```typescript
const result = {
  gameId: gameId,
  diceResult: diceResult,
  payout: contractService.microToStx(payout),
  betAmount: contractService.microToStx(betAmountMicro),
  target: gameTarget,
  gameMode: mode,
  isWinner: isWinner,  // ← Property is "isWinner"
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
};
```

### DiceAnimation was checking:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Property doesn't exist
{result.won ? (
  <h2>🎉 YOU WIN! 🎉</h2>
) : (
  <h2>Try Again!</h2>
)}
```

Since `result.won` is undefined, it's falsy, so it always showed "Try Again!" regardless of win/loss.

## The Fix

Changed DiceAnimation to use the correct property name:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Using isWinner
{result && !isRolling && (
  <div className={`result-banner ${result.isWinner ? 'win' : 'loss'}`}>
    {result.isWinner ? (
      <>
        <h2>🎉 YOU WIN! 🎉</h2>
        <p className="win-amount">+{result.payout.toFixed(2)} STX</p>
      </>
    ) : (
      <>
        <h2>😔 Try Again!</h2>
        <p>Better luck next time</p>
      </>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

## Changes Made

1. **Changed property check**: `result.won` → `result.isWinner`
2. **Updated CSS class**: Uses `result.isWinner` for win/loss styling
3. **Fixed payout display**: Added `.toFixed(2)` to format payout to 2 decimal places
4. **Added emoji**: Added 😔 to "Try Again!" message for better UX

## Files Changed
- ✅ `/my-app/components/DiceAnimation.tsx` - Updated property name from `won` to `isWinner`

## Result

### Before (Bug):
- ❌ Always showed "Try Again!" message
- ❌ Never showed win message even when winning
- ❌ CSS class was always 'loss'

### After (Fixed):
- ✅ Shows "🎉 YOU WIN! 🎉" when player wins
- ✅ Shows payout amount with proper formatting
- ✅ Shows "😔 Try Again!" when player loses
- ✅ Correct CSS styling (green for win, red for loss)

## Testing
1. Place a bet and win → Should show "YOU WIN" with payout
2. Place a bet and lose → Should show "Try Again"
3. Verify only ONE message shows at a time
4. Check that payout is formatted correctly (e.g., "5.00 STX")

**The result banner now displays correctly based on game outcome!** 🎉
