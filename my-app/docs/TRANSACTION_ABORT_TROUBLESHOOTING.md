# Transaction Failed: abort_by_response - Troubleshooting Guide

## Error Details
- **Error Code**: `(err u1)`  
- **Transaction ID**: `0x4468ad95f9b76791c52f1ec1f7d34de070565d0165e2a1a85945ad2cfd4a5446`
- **Status**: `abort_by_response`

## What This Means

### Error u1 from `stx-transfer?`
When `stx-transfer?` returns `(err u1)`, it means:
**"Sender does not have enough balance to complete the transfer"**

### Why This Happens in `resolve-game`

The contract code at line 143-145:
```clarity
(if (> total-payout u0)
  (try! (as-contract (stx-transfer? total-payout tx-sender player)))
  true
)
```

When using `as-contract`, the contract itself becomes the sender. So this tries to transfer STX from the **contract's balance** to the player.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Contract Balance vs House Balance
The contract tracks two balances:
1. **Actual STX Balance**: Real STX held by contract (currently 481.79 STX)
2. **House Balance Variable**: Tracked in code (`house-balance` variable)

The problem occurs when:
- House balance variable shows more STX than actually exists
- Or payout calculation exceeds available funds

### The Bug in Contract Logic

Look at lines 147-150 in the contract:
```clarity
(if is-winner
  (var-set house-balance (- (var-get house-balance) (- total-payout bet-amount)))
  (var-set house-balance (+ (var-get house-balance) bet-amount))
)
```

**Issue**: The house-balance variable can become HIGHER than the actual contract balance because:
1. Players send STX to the contract when betting
2. Contract receives the STX (actual balance increases)
3. But the house-balance variable doesn't always track it correctly

### When It Fails

If a player wins a large payout (e.g., 5x multiplier on 100 STX = 500 STX payout):
- Contract tries to send 500 STX
- But contract only has 481 STX
- `stx-transfer?` returns `(err u1)`
- Transaction aborts

## Solutions

### Immediate Workarounds

#### 1. **Fund the Contract**
Send more STX to the contract to ensure it can cover all potential payouts:
```bash
# Using Stacks CLI
stx send <amount> ST3Y2767DSNTBTP7Q86GRQ4NBG69C6SD1AKC3P4SK

# Recommended minimum: 1000 STX
```

#### 2. **Lower Bet Limits**
Reduce maximum bet amount to prevent large payouts:
- Current MAX_BET: 100 STX
- 5x multiplier = 500 STX payout
- Keep contract balance > max possible payout

#### 3. **Check Balance Before Betting**
Add UI check to ensure contract can cover potential payout:
```typescript
const maxPayout = betAmount * getMultiplier(gameMode);
const contractBalance = await getContractBalance();

if (contractBalance < maxPayout) {
  alert('Contract balance too low for this bet. Please try a smaller amount.');
  return;
}
```

### Long-Term Fix: Update Contract

The contract needs to be redeployed with improved logic:

```clarity
;; Add balance check before transfer
(define-public (resolve-game (game-id uint))
  (let (
    ;; ... existing code ...
    (contract-balance (stx-get-balance (as-contract tx-sender)))
  )
    ;; Check if contract has enough before trying to pay
    (asserts! (>= contract-balance total-payout) ERR_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS)
    
    ;; Safe to transfer now
    (if (> total-payout u0)
      (try! (as-contract (stx-transfer? total-payout tx-sender player)))
      true
    )
    ;; ... rest of code ...
  )
)
```

## Current Workaround in Frontend

The updated GameInterface.tsx now shows a helpful error message:

```
⚠️ Game resolution failed!

Possible reasons:
1. Contract has insufficient balance to pay winnings
2. Game was already resolved
3. Too soon to resolve (need next block)

Your bet is safe in the contract. Please try resolving again
in a moment, or contact support.
```

## Monitoring & Prevention

### 1. Check Contract Balance Regularly
```bash
curl -s "https://api.testnet.hiro.so/extended/v1/address/ST3Y2767DSNTBTP7Q86GRQ4NBG69C6SD1AKC3P4SK/stx"
```

### 2. Calculate Required Reserve
Minimum contract balance should be:
```
Required Balance = MAX_BET × MAX_MULTIPLIER × ACTIVE_GAMES
Example: 100 STX × 5 × 10 games = 5000 STX reserve
```

### 3. Add Balance Alerts
Monitor contract balance and alert when it drops below threshold:
```typescript
if (contractBalance < MIN_RESERVE) {
  notifyAdmin('Contract balance low!');
  disableLargeBets();
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Check current contract balance**: 481.79 STX
2. **Maximum single payout**: 100 STX × 5 = 500 STX
3. **Result**: **INSUFFICIENT!** Need to fund contract with at least 500 STX

### Action Required
```bash
# Send 500 STX to contract to cover payouts
# Or reduce MAX_BET to 96 STX (96 × 5 = 480 STX)
```

## Error Code Reference

| Error Code | Meaning | Solution |
|------------|---------|----------|
| `(err u1)` | Sender lacks funds | Fund contract |
| `(err u100)` | Unauthorized | Wrong caller |
| `(err u101)` | Invalid bet | Check bet parameters |
| `(err u102)` | Game not found | Invalid game ID |
| `(err u103)` | Already resolved | Don't resolve twice |
| `(err u104)` | Insufficient funds | Fund contract |
| `(err u105)` | Too soon to resolve | Wait for next block |

## Summary

**Problem**: Contract has 481 STX but tries to pay 500 STX (or more)  
**Cause**: Max bet (100 STX) × multiplier (5x) = 500 STX potential payout  
**Fix**: Either fund contract with more STX OR lower the MAX_BET limit  
**Status**: Frontend now shows helpful error message to users
