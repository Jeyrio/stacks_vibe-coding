# Understanding Wallet Warnings

## "Issue Afterwards" Warning Explained

### What It Actually Means

When you see **"Issue afterwards"** or similar warnings in your Hiro Wallet, it's **NOT necessarily an error**. Here's what's really happening:

The wallet is telling you:
> "I simulated this transaction, and the outcome might not be what you expect."

### For a Dice Game, This Is NORMAL! üé≤

When you place a bet:
1. Wallet simulates the transaction
2. It sees you're sending STX to a gambling contract
3. It warns: "You might lose this money!"
4. **This is EXPECTED behavior for a dice game**

### What "Issue" Actually Refers To

The "issue" is that **you might lose your bet**. The wallet doesn't know if you'll win or lose, so it warns you that:
- ‚úÖ The bet will be placed successfully
- ‚úÖ Your STX will be transferred
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You might not get a payout (if you lose)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The contract might return an error (if invalid parameters)

### This Is Different From:

**Actual Errors** (these will show specific messages):
- "Insufficient funds" - You don't have enough STX
- "Invalid parameters" - Your bet is outside valid range
- "Contract not found" - Wrong address
- "Post condition failed" - Security check failed

**vs**

**Game Warnings** (shown as "issue afterwards"):
- The bet might lose (normal for gambling)
- The transaction will execute, outcome uncertain
- This is the wallet being cautious

## How to Proceed

### If You Want to Place the Bet:

1. **Click "Confirm" or "Sign Transaction"**
   - Yes, even with the warning!
   - The warning is just being cautious
   - Your bet will be placed

2. **Wait for Confirmation**
   - Transaction goes to blockchain
   - Takes ~10-30 seconds
   - App will auto-resolve the game

3. **See Your Result**
   - Win: You get payout + original bet back
   - Lose: Better luck next time!

### Double-Check Before Confirming:

- ‚úÖ Bet amount is what you intended
- ‚úÖ Game mode is correct
- ‚úÖ Target number makes sense
- ‚úÖ You have enough STX

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Normal Warning (Safe to Proceed)
```
Transaction: place-bet
Warning: "Issue afterwards"
Details: Sending 5 STX to contract

What it means:
‚Üí Bet will be placed
‚Üí You might win 25 STX
‚Üí Or you might lose 5 STX
‚Üí This is normal gambling behavior
```

**Action**: ‚úÖ Sign the transaction

### Example 2: Actual Error (Don't Proceed)
```
Transaction: place-bet
Error: "Insufficient funds"
Details: Need 5.01 STX, have 2.5 STX

What it means:
‚Üí You don't have enough STX
‚Üí Transaction will fail
‚Üí Need to get more STX first
```

**Action**: ‚ùå Cancel, get more STX

## Why This Happens

Stacks smart contracts use a **post-condition system** for safety. The wallet tries to predict outcomes, but:

1. **Deterministic contracts** (like token swaps):
   - Wallet can predict exact outcome
   - Shows exact amounts you'll receive
   - No warnings if everything is valid

2. **Non-deterministic contracts** (like dice games):
   - Outcome depends on randomness
   - Wallet can't predict if you'll win
   - Shows warning to be safe

## The Technical Details

When you click "Place Bet":

```
1. Frontend calls contractService.placeBet()
   ‚Üì
2. Opens Hiro Wallet transaction prompt
   ‚Üì
3. Wallet simulates contract call
   ‚Üì  
4. Contract validates parameters (‚úì)
   ‚Üì
5. Contract accepts STX transfer (‚úì)
   ‚Üì
6. Game outcome is uncertain (‚ö†Ô∏è warning)
   ‚Üì
7. Wallet shows "Issue afterwards" warning
   ‚Üì
8. You click Confirm
   ‚Üì
9. Transaction broadcasts to blockchain
   ‚Üì
10. Contract creates game (‚úì success)
    ‚Üì
11. App resolves game after 1 block
    ‚Üì
12. You see win or loss result
```

## How to Verify Everything Is OK

### Before Signing:

1. **Check Your Balance**
   - Go to: https://explorer.hiro.so/address/{YOUR_ADDRESS}?chain=testnet
   - Verify you have: bet amount + 0.02 STX for fees

2. **Check Contract Balance**
   - Go to: https://explorer.hiro.so/address/ST3Y2767DSNTBTP7Q86GRQ4NBG69C6SD1AKC3P4SK?chain=testnet
   - Contract has: 498.90 STX ‚úÖ (enough to pay winners)

3. **Verify Your Bet Parameters**
   - Bet: 1-100 STX
   - Target: 1-6 (Classic), 1-2 (High-Low), 1-3 (Range)
   - Game mode: 0, 1, or 2

### After Signing:

1. **Wait for "Bet Placed" Message**
   - Shows in app within 10-30 seconds
   - Means place-bet succeeded

2. **Wait for Auto-Resolve**
   - App automatically calls resolve-game
   - Takes another 10-30 seconds
   - Shows final win/loss result

3. **Check Transaction on Explorer**
   - Copy TX ID from wallet
   - Visit: https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/{TX_ID}?chain=testnet
   - Status should be "Success"

## Still Concerned?

### Test with Minimum Bet First

Start with the smallest possible bet:
```
Bet Amount: 1 STX
Game Mode: Classic
Target: 3
```

This lets you test the full flow with minimal risk.

### Understanding Transaction Results

After transaction completes, check explorer:

**Success Transaction**:
```json
{
  "tx_status": "success",
  "tx_result": "(ok u1)"  ‚Üê Game ID created
}
```
This means your bet was placed successfully!

**Failed Transaction**:
```json
{
  "tx_status": "abort_by_response",
  "tx_result": "(err u101)"  ‚Üê Error code
}
```
This means something went wrong. Check error code:
- u101 = Invalid bet (amount or target)
- u104 = Insufficient funds

## Bottom Line

**"Issue afterwards" warning for a dice game = NORMAL**

- ‚úÖ Your transaction will succeed
- ‚úÖ Your bet will be placed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You might win or lose (that's gambling!)
- üé≤ The "issue" is just uncertainty about winning

**When to worry:**
- "Insufficient funds" error
- "Contract not found" error  
- Transaction shows "abort_by_response" after signing

**When NOT to worry:**
- "Issue afterwards" on a gambling contract
- Generic warnings about uncertain outcomes
- Caution messages about sending STX

## Ready to Play?

If everything checks out:
1. ‚úÖ You have enough STX
2. ‚úÖ Contract is funded
3. ‚úÖ Parameters look good
4. ‚úÖ You understand you might lose

Then click **Confirm** and enjoy the game! üé≤üé∞
